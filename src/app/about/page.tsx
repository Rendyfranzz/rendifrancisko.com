            I am currently pursuing a degree in Informatics at Institut
            Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember. My journey in programming began with
            exploring various technologies and quickly led me to work on several
            projects as a Frontend Developer. Over time, I have concentrated on
            web development with JavaScript technologies, particularly using
            React and Next.js.

            involved in. If you'd like to discuss anything or share your
            thoughts, feedback, or suggestions, please donâ€™t hesitate to get in
            touch. I look forward to hearing from you!
