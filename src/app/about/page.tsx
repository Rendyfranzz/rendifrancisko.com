            I hold a degree in Informatics from Institut Teknologi Sepuluh
            Nopember. My programming journey began with exploring various
            technologies, which quickly led me to work on several projects as a
            Frontend Developer. Over time, I have focused on web development,
            specializing in JavaScript technologies, particularly React and
            Next.js.
