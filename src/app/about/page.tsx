            I am a graduate of Informatics Engineering from Sepuluh Nopember
            Institute of Technology. My journey started with exploring various
            technologies, which quickly led me to work on several projects. Over
            time, I focused on web development specializing in Frontend and
            Backend. On the Frontend I use JavaScript, especially React and
            Next.js, while on the Backend I use Go, Express JS, and Restify JS.
