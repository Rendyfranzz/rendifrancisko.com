## Description

**Weather App** is my first project using React, built to provide real-time weather forecasts. I developed this web application by following a YouTube tutorial, which unfortunately I can no longer recall. Despite the time that has passed, this project remains a significant milestone in my journey as a developer.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: Utilized for building the application with server-side rendering and static site generation, ensuring fast load times and improved SEO.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Employed for styling the application. Tailwindâ€™s utility-first approach allowed for a modern and responsive design with efficient styling.
