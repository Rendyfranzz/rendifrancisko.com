## Description

A website that can be used to convert long URLs into shorter and more memorable ones. This web service is useful for shortening or simplifying links, making them easier to share on social media, text, or other communication platforms.
I created this website to learn Next.js.


## Project Overview

**Shorten Link** is a web application designed to convert long URLs into shorter, more manageable links. This service simplifies URLs to make them more user-friendly, especially useful for sharing on social media, text messages, or other communication platforms. The primary goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with Next.js.

## Key Features

- **URL Shortening**: Convert long URLs into compact and easy-to-share links.
- **Custom Aliases**: Optionally create custom short links with meaningful aliases.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Track click statistics for each shortened link (if implemented).
- **User Authentication**: Secure access to user-specific features (optional).

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: Framework for building the React application with server-side rendering.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing URL mappings and user data.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for designing responsive and modern UI.
- **Prisma**: ORM for database access and management.

## Challenges Faced

- **Handling URL Redirection**: Implementing efficient and secure URL redirection to ensure users are directed to the correct destination.
- **Scalability**: Ensuring the application can handle a growing number of links and user requests.
- **Custom Aliases**: Allowing users to create custom short links while avoiding collisions and ensuring uniqueness.

## How to Use

1. **Enter URL**: Paste the long URL you want to shorten into the input field.
2. **Generate Short Link**: Click the "Shorten" button to create a short URL.
3. **Copy and Share**: Copy the generated short URL and use it as needed.
