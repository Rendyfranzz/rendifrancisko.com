## Description

Welcome to **Silhouette Studio**, my final project for the Software Project Management course!

This website was created for a photo studio reservation system in collaboration with **Silhouette**, a local photo studio. It enables users to book photo sessions effortlessly and integrates with the Xendit payment gateway for secure transactions.

I was deeply involved in the full-stack development of this website, gaining comprehensive experience in both front-end and back-end technologies. This project is a testament to my skills in building a complete, functional web application.

## Tech Stack

- **React.js**: Utilized for the user interface. React’s performance optimizations and component-based architecture facilitated the creation of a dynamic and responsive application, enhancing both user experience and SEO.
- **Redux**: Employed for state management. Redux helped manage the application's state efficiently, ensuring smooth data flow and interactions across the application.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling. Tailwind’s utility-first approach enabled rapid and consistent design, creating a modern and responsive user interface.
- **Express.js**: Applied on the server side. Express’s simplicity and efficiency allowed for quick development of backend services, providing a solid foundation for server-side functionality.
