## Description

The website is intended for the final project of the Software Project Management course. The website is designed for photo studio reservations.
Silhouette is the photo studio that collaborated with me to create this website. The web is already integrated with the Xendit payment gateway.
I was involved in the full-stack development process of this website.

## TechStack

### React js

I use React JS to display the user interface. ReactJS can improve Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for web applications by enhancing performance

### Express js

I use Express JS to speed up development because Express JS is easier to understand for beginners. Here, I am just learning backend development.
